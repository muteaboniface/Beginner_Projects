##  How to use the programme
	* The script currently assumes that the status of the file is known
    * Run the script then select encode, if initial state of file is decoded.
	* NOTE!! : make sure that you are aware of the initial file state before performing action
	
    * To terminate program, select terminate
        * You are now set---your file is save.

# Once you you run the script, and select the tryme.txt file, you should obtain the .py code

### TO DO
Add functionality to know selected file status when script is loaded and file selected
Allow functionality to perform file operation while on the script.
